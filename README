SmsSender
=========

This plugin aims to provide very easy way to send an sms from your Rails app.
The service used for sending sms messages is Polish http://smsapi.pl. In order
to use the plugin you have to sign up at http://smsapi.pl. They give you a few
free smses, so you can test how the plugin works for you without paying.

Installation
=============

To install the plugin, just add it in your gemfile:

gem "sms_sender"

Configuration
==============

All you need to do is add following lines in your config/application.rb:

config.sms_sender_login="your login at smsapi.pl"
config.sms_sender_password="your password at smsapi.pl"
config.sms_sender_eco=1

Alternatively, if you don't want to send eco smses, you comment the last line and add:

#config.sms_sender_eco=1
config.sms_sender_from="5555"

You may also wish to send test requests to smsapi while you develop your app. I always use
it development mode. Just add in config/development.rb:

config.sms_sender_test=1
